/**
 * CXMail in the Obsidian vault's colours.
 *
 * The palette comes from Onyx (`fetch_vault_look` on the Rust side, which
 * validates every value into `[u8; 3]`); this module turns it into CXMail's own
 * tokens. Onyx derived its palette for an OPAQUE window, and CXMail's is glass,
 * so two things are re-derived here rather than taken as given:
 *
 * 1. **Text shades, in light mode.** Light glass over a dark desktop composites
 *    grey (gotcha #59), and Onyx's muted shade holds 3.2:1 against the vault's
 *    ground — which is 3.2:1 only while nothing shows through. So secondary,
 *    muted and faint are re-mixed from the vault's ink toward its ground until
 *    they hold the same floors the built-in palette is pinned to, measured
 *    against the darkest ground the glass can produce: a black desktop at the
 *    top of the slider (`GLASS_TEXT_FLOORS`).
 * 2. **The glass floor.** If even the vault's ink cannot hold muted's 3:1 there,
 *    the palette gets a higher `paneFloor` — the window goes more opaque for
 *    that palette instead of the text going unreadable.
 *
 * Dark mode takes Onyx's shades as they are. Its failure is the mirror image —
 * light text on a pane washed out by a WHITE wallpaper — and the built-in dark
 * palette has the same open question; answering it for one and not the other
 * would make the vault theme the odd one out.
